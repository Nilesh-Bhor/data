## Example

A real-world example of data.world’s use comes from **The Associated Press (AP)**, a global news organization that adopted data.world to manage and share data for its journalistic efforts.

#### **Context & Challenge**:
The Associated Press is a large, global news agency that gathers data from multiple sources to report on news stories. In covering complex topics like elections, public policy, and demographics, AP reporters often deal with vast datasets that need to be analyzed, shared, and published quickly. However, there were several challenges:
- **Data Silos**: Data was stored in different locations across the organization, making it difficult for journalists to collaborate and access relevant information.
- **Data Management**: Managing and keeping track of large datasets from multiple sources (governments, polling agencies, etc.) was challenging.
- **Collaboration**: AP needed to collaborate with external partners, including local news outlets and journalists, on shared projects like election results and public data analysis.
- **Open Data Sharing**: AP wanted to make some datasets publicly available for transparency and to promote data-driven journalism.

#### **How AP Used data.world**:
1. **Data Cataloging and Centralization**: AP used data.world to catalog and centralize datasets related to its news coverage, including election data, census data, and public records. This made it easy for journalists and external partners to find, understand, and use the data for reporting and analysis.

2. **Collaboration Across Teams**: Journalists from different regions and backgrounds could collaborate on data projects in real-time. data.world’s platform allowed teams to share annotations, discuss insights, and even write SQL queries together. This collaborative environment ensured that journalists were working from a single source of truth, minimizing errors and improving the speed of reporting.

3. **Data Sharing with External Partners**: AP used data.world to share datasets with its local news partners, enabling them to access up-to-date data, such as live election results. This allowed local outlets to use AP’s data for their own stories, promoting transparency and cooperation across the news industry.

4. **Public Data Access**: For certain projects, AP leveraged data.world’s open data platform to make datasets available to the public. This was particularly important during elections, where transparency of election data was critical. It also helped other journalists, researchers, and academics access and analyze AP’s data for independent research.

5. **Self-Service Analytics**: data.world empowered journalists with limited technical expertise to perform self-service analytics. Reporters could explore datasets, filter data, and generate insights without relying on dedicated data teams. This reduced the time to publish stories and allowed more flexibility in the reporting process.

6. **Integration with Existing Tools**: data.world integrated smoothly with AP’s existing data tools and workflows. The platform’s ability to work with tools like Excel, Tableau, and SQL databases helped streamline AP’s data analysis and visualization efforts.

#### **Impact**:
- **Faster, More Accurate Reporting**: With data.world’s collaborative features and centralized data access, AP was able to streamline its reporting process. Journalists had quicker access to accurate data, allowing them to publish stories faster.
- **Improved Collaboration**: The platform enabled effective collaboration between AP’s internal teams and external partners, including local news outlets. This was particularly important during major events like elections, where real-time data collaboration was essential.
- **Transparency and Public Engagement**: By making data available to the public via data.world, AP promoted transparency in its reporting, particularly around election results and public policy. This engagement fostered trust with readers and other journalists.
- **Efficient Data Management**: The ability to easily search, filter, and analyze datasets helped AP manage the growing complexity of its data landscape. This was particularly useful when dealing with large, frequently updated datasets like election results.

#### **Election Coverage Example**:
During U.S. elections, AP gathers data from thousands of local election offices and compiles it into a central database. This data is used to power live election result maps, coverage, and analysis. By using data.world:
- AP’s journalists and external partners could collaborate in real-time to analyze the data, make predictions, and report results.
- Local news organizations could pull election data from AP’s data.world platform and incorporate it into their own stories.
- The public and other researchers had access to the same data, ensuring transparency in the reporting process.

#### **Conclusion**:
The Associated Press’ use of data.world illustrates how the platform can be a powerful tool for organizations that rely on large, complex datasets and need to collaborate across teams or with external partners. The combination of data cataloging, collaboration, and open data sharing made it an ideal solution for AP’s journalistic data needs, especially during high-stakes events like elections.

data.world is a powerful tool for anyone looking to manage, govern, and collaborate on data, providing a balance of governance and ease of use across teams and organizations.
