## Example

A real-world example of Atlan's use comes from **WeWork**, the global flexible workspace provider. WeWork adopted Atlan to address challenges related to data governance, collaboration, and scaling analytics across their global teams.

#### **Context & Challenge**:
WeWork manages a massive amount of data related to their spaces, customers, and operations, with a global footprint. Their data landscape was complex, involving multiple data sources like customer data, property data, financial data, and operations data. Different teams, including data engineers, analysts, and business stakeholders, needed to access this data for various purposes such as decision-making, reporting, and improving operations.

WeWork faced challenges like:
- **Data silos**: Data was stored in different systems and managed by different teams, leading to fragmented access.
- **Collaboration difficulties**: Collaboration between data teams was slow, as there wasn’t a centralized platform to view, share, and discuss data.
- **Data governance**: Ensuring data quality and security across different geographies and departments was difficult.
- **Scaling analytics**: With rapid growth, WeWork needed to scale their data analytics efforts while maintaining governance and quality.

#### **How WeWork Used Atlan**:
1. **Unified Data Catalog**: Atlan served as a centralized data catalog for WeWork. It brought together all their data assets, regardless of the source (databases, data lakes, cloud services), into a single platform. Teams could easily discover and search for datasets, which reduced duplication of effort and improved efficiency.

2. **Collaboration and Documentation**: Atlan allowed teams to collaborate on data by providing features such as annotations, discussions, and data documentation. Data engineers and analysts could document data transformations, workflows, and metadata, making it easier for other teams to understand and use the data. The collaboration features enhanced communication between technical teams and business users, fostering a data-driven culture.

3. **Governance and Access Control**: WeWork could define and enforce governance policies using Atlan. The platform allowed them to control who had access to which datasets, ensuring that sensitive data was protected. Atlan’s role-based access control and automated data lineage tracking enabled WeWork to maintain data security and compliance, which was crucial for handling sensitive financial and customer information.

4. **Self-Service Analytics**: Atlan’s platform empowered WeWork’s business users to perform self-service analytics. Non-technical users could easily find the data they needed, reducing the reliance on data engineers and freeing up their time for more complex tasks.

5. **Integration with Modern Data Stack**: Atlan seamlessly integrated with WeWork’s existing data stack, including Snowflake, Tableau, and other analytics tools. This helped WeWork streamline its data workflows and improve operational efficiency.

#### **Impact**:
